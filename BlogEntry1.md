## Experience with Haskell Recursion in Functional Programming

### Installing Haskell

Installing Haskell was initially confusing but overall not very challenging. First, I went to the Haskell homepage to download it for windows. However, before I could install Haskell, the steps on Haskells website said to configure chocolatey first. I followed that link and download chocolatey and downloaded it. Then I was able to go back to the Haskell website and download Haskell as well. From there I copied the commands from the webpage into the command prompt and everything installed fairly easily. I did run into the issue where everything installed perfectly excpet for Cabal, which threw an error. I was worried that this would pose an issue in the future so I made a note of it, but so far I have not had any problems.
