### Comparing Discrete Mathematics Relations: Symmetric, Reflexive, and Transitive

Reflexitivity, Symmetry, and Transitivity are all types of Relations in Discrete mathematics. Relations are crucial in mathematics because they help define relationships between objects of the same sets or even objects in different sets and different sets entirely.

### Defining the Relations

**Symmetric Relations**

In just basic mathematics, symmetry is defined as, for real numbers x and y,
```
if x = y, then y = x
```
In discrete math, the idea remains the same, but the syntax varies. In discrete, the symmetric relation is represented as
```
Assuming R⊆ AxA,
xRy --> yRx
for all x,y ∈A
```
For those of us who better understand English than discrete, this is saying that, Assuming R is a subset of the set AxA, xRy is the same as yRx for every x and y in the set of A.
