## Extensions of Lambda Calculus

### Introduction
Overall, Lambda Calculus is a very flexible and versile language. It allows us to "extend" the langauge, or add features to the language that help us create a binding mechanism for variables so we do not have to redefine them my hand each time. This is also known as **Higher Order Abstract Syntax** (HOAS for short).

**Definition**

Higher Order Abstract Syntax is a technique for the representation of abstract syntax trees with languages that have variable binders. HOAS can be used in math where a graphs edges are binding sites associted with variables. It can also be used with de Burjin indeces and logical frameworks.
