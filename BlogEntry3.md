## Functional vs. Imperiative Programming 

### What Functional and Imperiative Programming Are
Functional programming was created to support a purely functional approach to problem solving and is a form of declarative programming. This means that one must break their problem up into a function or several functions to solve it. In Imperiative programming, on the other hand, a programmer must write out the specific steps the computer must take to solve a problem. Knowing this, it makes sense that we are only allowed to have functions in Haskell and can not work outside of them like you can in C++, C#, and Java. 

### Key Differences
While these definitions help me to understand the key differences, breaking down the key differences between the two languages greatly helped me to understand them more. This chart outlines the main differences between the two types of programming.

<u>Characteristic</u>       	       | Imperative approach                                                  	| Functional approach </u>

|Programmer focus	           | How to perform tasks (algorithms) and how to track changes in state. 	| What information is desired and what transformations are required|
|State changes	             | Important                                                           	  | Non-existent|
|Order of execution	         | Important	                                                            | Low importance|
|Primary flow control	       | Loops, conditionals, and function (method) calls	                      | Function calls, including recursion|
|Primary manipulation unit	 | Instances of structures or classes.	                                  | Functions as first-class objects and data collections|
